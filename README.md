# 🌟 Suicidal Ideation Detection

## 📖 Project Overview
This project aims to develop machine learning models that utilize linguistic patterns extracted using Natural Language Processing (NLP) from Reddit data to detect suicidal ideation. The primary goal is to enhance early detection and provide real-time monitoring support for individuals at risk. You can **access the project [here](https://suicidal-ideation-detector.streamlit.app)**


## 🎯 Research Objectives
1. Develop Machine Learning Models: Create models using linguistic features extracted from Reddit data to predict suicidal ideation.
2. Evaluate Model Effectiveness: Assess the performance of various models to identify the most effective one.
3. Design a Real-Time Monitoring System: Implement a user-friendly system to provide real-time support and monitoring for individuals expressing suicidal thoughts.


## 🏆 Results
Among all the models created, DistilBERT performed best and was used for deployment using Streamlit. The user interface offers real-time monitoring feature and integrates with Gemini to provide advice if the text is detected as **SUICIDAL**.


## 💬 Conclusion
This project showcases the powerful intersection of linguistic analysis and machine learning to detect suicidal ideation. By providing timely support, we can make a difference in the lives of those in need. Together, we can help ensure that no one feels alone or overlooked. 💖
